Changelog for the MultiList UO Shard Tool

Release 5
	Support for including port in registerServer= line.
	Registerserver IP/URL and port can be separated by , ; or :.
	
	Comments can now be placed in the middle of lines, and are parsed
	correctly. Previously, comments were only considered comments 
	if the // was at the very beginning of the line.
	Note that if a :// is in a line, then that line is considered
	to be comment-free unless the first 2 characters are //. Thus,
	lines with any variant on http://, ftp://, and so forth,
	are treated properly (unless you try to put a comment later in
	the line).
	
	Example: ShardName=MyShardsName //This is the name of my shard
	
	The default registerservers.ini which is created when the program
	is first run now contains an entry for the OnlineUO shard list.

	The registerservers.ini is written in the 2-character endline format
	now, since more people use Windows than Unix, and since Windows Notepad
	doesn't display the endlines correctly if they're in the 1-character format.
	
	Changelog.txt added.
	
	Blank lines in registerservers.ini no longer cause MultiList to exit.

Release 4
	The program correctly reads registerservers.ini if it is written with the
	2-character endline format rather than the 1-character endline format.

Release 3
	You can now run MultiList on a different computer than your shard and it 
	will work fine, if you set the DynIP option in registerservers.ini 
	to the IP of your shard (or it's dynamic IP if it has one.).

 	(Note that the regpass ensures that nobody can overwrite your shard's
 	entry in the list server by using MultiList like this.)

Release 2
	MultiList starts a thread for each registerserver, but now waits 20
	seconds in between starting each one. Since it waits 10 seconds a
	thread starts to send the secondary information, the effect is of it
	sending the initial information to one shard, pausing 10 seconds,
	sending the secondary information to that shard, pausing 10 seconds,
	sending the initial information the the second shard, etc...

Release 1
	Initial Release
