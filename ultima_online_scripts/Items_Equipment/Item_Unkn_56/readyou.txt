Nah, just joking(not the leave credit part :P), to install this just
add the event e_beggingnew in spheretables.scp.

Example:
...
Necromancy=100.0

ON=@Login
EVENTS +e_shard_event1
EVENTS +e_beggingnew
...

and so on. This script includes 2 different ¿upgrades?, the first
is for the itemid skill and the second for the begging skill. If u
don't want one of them just remove their part in the script(I wrote
which parts are from one skill and from the other).
The skill itemid and it's add flag 01 part fits well with the
adminofdiamondrealm unidentified items script, so be sure to check it
out!
Enjoy the script and excuse my english, sometimes poor, sometimes crazy :).

---->Features of begging:
     -------------------
Everyone you beg, a memory item is generated inside the NPC so that
you can only beg once. So, a NPC only gives money ONCE to anyone.
That will surely discourage some, but is part of the fun and I think
it adds realism to the system. To non-npc asking(player chars I mean)
it generates a aleatory phrase based on the skill. It doesn't force non-npcs
to give money.

---->Features of itemid:
     ------------------
It allows you a more difficulty based system(it checks the MOREY of the
item to increase it's difficulty to appraise). Just create a event to prevent
using non-identified items(I made it over the adminofdiamondrealm system, but I'm
not going to post it, download the event and do it yourself) and you will increase
a lot the importance of this skill. It also has some things removed(with //) to 
show the hitpoints and...well...look at it yourself.
