Before ever running this server, you must edit the auth.cfg file.  The first line is the username required to log on the server and the second line is the password associated to it.  As of now, it is not possible to supply more than one user/pass pair.  When this is done, you can double click the jar file to start the server (which has to be running whenever you wish to allow clients to connect to it).  The program shows no interface so you will probably see the hourglass cursor until the server has finished loading.  When it is done, you can see the program running in the processes section of the task list as either java or javaw.  To stop the server, simply click the End Task button when selecting either java  or javaw in the task list.
