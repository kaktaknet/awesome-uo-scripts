<p><b>Installation/Setup</b><br>
To install, simply edit the configuration file to fit your needs and upload all
the included files (minus this one if you desire) into a web-accessible
directory.&nbsp; Configuration is achieved through changing the different
variables to match your setup.&nbsp; The variables should be straight
forward.&nbsp; Near the end there is a section of functions that define the
output of the program for initial startup and success message.&nbsp; The ones
that come with the default program are pretty basic and should be self
explanatory, but only experienced PHP users should attempt to modify them
further.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Support<br>
</b>If you need support, help, or find bugs; ask on the Script Sharing message
board.</p>
