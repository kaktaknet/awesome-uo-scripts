<h1>Installing PySphere (PySphere Release 16)</h1>
<p>
<p><ol>
<li>Extract this entire zip file to your Sphere folder. PySphere.bat and the PySphere folder go in the same folder as SphereSvr.exe.
<li>Look at the sample .py files in the 'PySphere\examples' folder.
<li>Write some .py scripts of your own and stick 'em in the 'scripts\custom' folder.
<li>Run PySphere.Bat to compile those .py scripts into Sphere .scp scripts.
<li>Wow, that was easy. Note: The first time will be slow, because PySphere has to build a list of defnames in SCP files.
	It only does this once, however, unless you delete defs.ini, in which case it will do it again.)
