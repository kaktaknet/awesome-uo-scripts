 Lightsource Modification to sphereitem.scp for Sphere
 By: Thadius, Tranquillus Decorum
 
 These were all the south and east facing building windows
 with improper light effects added to them. What I did was
 made the changes listed below, AND removed the id number from
 the dupelist for each. I purposely left commented dupelist numbers
 for easy reference.
 
 This is a very long and tedious process so you must be precise!
 I recommend backing up your sphereitem.scp BEFORE starting this.

 The //DUPEITEM=XXXX refers to the dupelist that it's number
 needs to be removed from.
