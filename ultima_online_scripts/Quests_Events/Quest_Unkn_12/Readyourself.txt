Reproducing system 0.2 for chocobos. 

//New Stuff:
I changed the event e_dead with a item in the chocobo, do not worry to implement this as
every chocobo will get it as soon as he sees a person. Maybe you'll get a event unknown error,
I havent tested it, but I think you could just add this lines of code:

[EVENTS e_malefemale]
ON=@CLICK
IF !(<FINDID.i_memory_oldnesschoco>)
SRC.NEWITEM i_memory_oldnesschoco
SRC.ACT.CONT <UID>
SRC.ACT.TIMER=10
ENDIF
IF (<ISEVENT.E_dead>)  <---  //Or whatever event u need
EVENTS -e_dead         <---
ENDIF                  <---
IF (0<TAG.MALE>==1)
VAR.GENDER=male
ELSE
VAR.GENDER=female
ENDIF
MESSAGE [<VAR.GENDER>]

Besides of this, the item will spend more from birth to death, (about a week). Bad things
about this system: The chocobo won't feel older till you dismount it. With sphere 55r+ versions you can figure out how to make chocobos grow without dismounting them easily but I don't use it so you'll have to figure out yourself(on=@dclick and then go trying lol)


What does this script do:
-Mainly, this script allows you to, using a nut, create a new chocobo with a mix of their father's/
mother's strenght [VAR.STRGAIN,VAR.DEXGAIN] and newbie skills. This chocobo will have a tag 
that will allow him to increase it's skills and stats faster than his parents. In any case, chocobos
die with time so u'll need to reproduce them in order to get new ones.

There are 6 types of chocobo:
-Different chocobos: Mutation of the race, very random. Cannot die and can be trained.
-Yellow chocobos: the worst, weaker race. Can die and cannot be trained.
-Blue chocobos: A weak race too, but less. Can die and can be trained.
-Green chocobos: Cannot reproduce, they are kinda strong.
-Black chocobos: A good race. Can die and be trained
-Golden chocobos: The God's chosen chocobos. Cannot die and can be trained.

The types of chocobo you get mixing races depends on the races of the father/mother, 2 random
numbers and the power of the nut. [VAR.TYPEFINAL]

You must also place someone to sell the nuts or some monsters to drop them, and put some
chocobos in the world.

This script has been tested in a crowded shard without apparent errors. msgs: waghk@hotmail.com
