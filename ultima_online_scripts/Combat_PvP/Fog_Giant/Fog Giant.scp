//Fog Giant, R1.6. Created 12/10/04-12/15/04 for use in any 55i-55r series shards.
//Scripted by Khaotic Solitaire. Admin/Owner/Co-owner of Elusive Shadows game shard. Admin/Co-owner of Malkuth game shard.
//Please leave header intact. Do not steal others scripts. Any mods done, just add your name. Do not take credit where credit //is not due.

//Any concerns and issues please contact me at khaotic_solitaire@hotmail.com
//
//Giants are being implimented into the server to represent more fantasy realism, per se. Even though you notice this is a //titan minus all the high str and hitpoints, its skills make up for that lacking, as does its high dam. In it's own glory //on a standard RP, PvM shard, this is a moderate advesary by my calculations and testing.
//
//Revisions:
//R1.0
//-Original concept and creature created. Harnasses a hide skill that lets the Giant hide in fog(per se) when no one is //near.
//-Titan skills and stats, for testing purposes. All testing is done with gm skills, 100 in stats. Full plate, order //shield, and viking sword. Bow was also tested.
//Testing completed. Complete change of stats block, skill block. Standard sphere difficuly, not challenging enough. Added //Maxhits line to give more HP then Str(this is 55r addition).
//R1.1
//-Karma/Fame increase/decrease.
//-Skills, added in more balanced calculations to fighting skills to make up for low str and hp.
//-Resources changed to give more meat from killing such a large humanoid.
//-Added in use of a Club, which is newbied in sense of realism, no player should be able to fight with a giant's club. //This also supplements its high dam making him a tougher fighter. If a disarm function is used, he will still have a high //dam rating due to high base damage.
//-More varied skill min/max. RP representation mainly to represent a feeble giant vs healthier one. Adds variety too. //Never know if you are fighting a giant that can kill you in one hit or is weak. Confuses players.
//R1.2
//-Increased Maxhits. Hitpoints was not sufficient enough for a giant to me.
//-Added a proper loot after testing combat. Least for other shards.
//-Raised parrying incase GM's want to add a shield for giant to use. This should be newbied. Again realism.
//-Added a names template.
//-Changed club from i_club to i_club_giant, i_club_giant adds more damage to attacks. Template included.
//R1.3
//-Added Giant Hides and Cut Giant Hide Leathers to script. In case anyone wants to make leather armor from this.
//-Added poison immunity event. Poison seemed to effective on them.. I figure a giant has better immune system, so why not //add in immunity.
//-changed i_rock and i_boulder to use templates.
//R1.4
//-Giant was having issues with over weight from tm_boulders, tm_rocks, took out 2 tm_rock lines.
//-Added mt_run to CAN line. Found it useless that the giant cannot catch up to his advesaries.
//R1.5
//-Complete rebalance, issues in dieing fast from archers with rare weapons. Str, dex, int,  maxhits RAISED!
//-ARMOR value RAISED!! Taking too much damage from archers. 46 armor value used now!! 19 was too WEAK!
//R1.6
//-Giant shield made, to lower AR back to 19 and provide a use for his parrying skill. Gives him better armor value.
//*********************************************Bug Issues/Concerns/Future Additions******************************************
//-Adding in a rand chance to catch archery projectiles. Thus making archery chars have a similar difficult time fighting as //do the hand to hand combat based chars.
//-Adding in on=@death trigger to spawn a "puff" of "fog" so to say.
//-Have to apparently add in a couple lines to force it to throw rocks and boulders. Doesn't seem to be a hardcoded Titan //function. Maybe a check for char distance should be used.
//-I think this might be the end to this script when it is finally finished. Nothing else seems applicable for its use.
//**************************************************Testing COnclusions******************************************************
//So far, Fog Giant is a high Dmg.. and a worth while advesary. It can take alot of Dmg, and more or less I myself use the //46 armor value if I want a boss giant or a tougher mob.
//Also might add a "fog" anim when it dies.
//If someone makes a leather armor for the hides it should add about 2.5-5.0 Hiding for each piece. At most add in maybe a //small str bonus. Nothing too ridiculous. Since this would make sense for a fog giant.
