Reproducing system 0.1 for chocobos. 

What does this script do:
-Mainly, this script allows you to, using a nut, create a new chocobo with a mix of their father's/
mother's strenght [VAR.STRGAIN,VAR.DEXGAIN] and newbie skills. This chocobo will have a tag 
that will allow him to increase it's skills and stats faster than his parents. In any case, chocobos
die due environchange so u'll need to reproduce them in order to get new ones.

There are 6 types of chocobo:
-Different chocobos: Mutation of the race, very random. Cannot die and can be trained.
-Yellow chocobos: the worst, weaker race. Can die and cannot be trained.
-Blue chocobos: A weak race too, but less. Can die and can be trained.
-Black chocobos: A good race. Can die and be trained
-Golden chocobos: The God's chosen chocobos. Cannot die and can be trained.

The types of chocobo you get mixing races depends on the races of the father/mother, 2 random
numbers and the power of the nut. [VAR.TYPEFINAL]

Notes: Maybe I've put too much tag's in this script. I just wanted to make it useful, so that's
why I put the dead on environchange. Maybe u could set that only born chocobos can be trained
and that will encourage players to reproduce them.

You must also place someone to sell the nuts or some monsters to drop them, and put some
chocobos in the world.

Also this script wasn't tested in a player-crowded shard so it may present some bugs I haven't
been able to see. Sorry about that, and please notify them to me so I can improve it to waghk@hotmail.com
