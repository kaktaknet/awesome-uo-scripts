VENDOR SYSTEM v.2

Yes I know there still may be bugs :)

INSTALLATION
************

Copy the included file (not this one) into your scripts directory and load it.  If you have a previous version of my vendor system, just overwrite the older file with this one and do a resync.

USAGE
*****

Place signs where you want players to be able to place vendors.  In this release Gamemasters are able to control the vendor just as if he/she were the owner as well as a few more options on the menu (feel free to make these look pretty :)

To test, place a sign along with 15K in your pack, and doubleclick the sign.
