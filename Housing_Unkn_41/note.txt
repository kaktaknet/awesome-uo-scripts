The *.comp.scp files are the component files. >extracts from multiscripter.    (I saved ya a step, :)   )

The *.jpg and *.wsc files are not my own. They used to be freely available on http://www2.raidway.ne.jp/~kandt/english.htm , which is no longer available online. (Risa's Ultima Online Page).

The doors and/or stairs may not be placed correctly and may not work correctly for some of the multi's. (falling through floor)(not my fault, they were made with that error)

If you do use my *.scp files as templates:
The number in the ITEMDEF of the script file must be changed to the ID #, located in InsideUO, after you have patched your Verdata.
