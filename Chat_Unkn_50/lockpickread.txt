Ok, installing this script is very easy, you just have to change the type of the i_lockpick item
in sphereitemb4.scp for the type in the script (t_lockpickwarro), then add the types of lock you
want in sphereskills.scp, so that people can craft them, and then add the main script in your 
scripts folder. That should do it, but there are a few things you might like to know.
First, all the predefined t_door_locked that are in the game will have by default the worst lock
(that is, MORE2H=0), so if u need some place not to be accesed by journeyman lockpickers, set it's
MORE2h to 3 or 4.
Second, this script hasn't been tested in a shard with people(I'm still looking for host :P) so
if u find any bug please send me a mail.
Third and most important, have fun with the script and beware of the house stealers :).
Ah, and also think that you might put any chest in a container, so it's timer won't activate,
so don't expect the explosive lockpick in chests (well I'm trying, maybe I'll find out how),
so if u were wondering why there's a check so that u can't set this type of lock to chests, 
thats why.
