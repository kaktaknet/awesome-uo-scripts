TERMS OF USE:

	I request that you either send me an email at michaelleejones104@gmail.com or add me to msn messenger at michaelleejones104@hotmail.com. Include all bugs, requests, suggestions, etc.

INSTRUCTIONS ON USE:

A) TO USE THIS SCRIPT: Type .go 5138,1441,2 and add either a black chest (.add i_chest_black). Then type .go 5316,1420 and add a white chest (.add i_chest_white). Set up the arena however else you want it.
Next say .go West Bridge and announce the event to people

B) Type .cth and target where you want the stone to be. Make it out of guard territory. The stone will bank all of their stuff and give them new things for the event, so no need to bank. When the players are done with double clicking the stone, put it in your pack and double click it yourself. 

C) Announce the rules, then say .region.allclients stone to unstone them. Then they're off.

D) Once finished, say .cth_end and target where you want the finishing stone to be. 

E) HOW TO PLAY: Go around and kill the opposite team. Every time you kill some one, you will get a head and a system message telling you to put it in the box. Go to your teams box and drop the head in. You will score a point. When you are at fifty, stop them and announce who won. You can stone them by .region.allclients stone

F) GIVE THE PRIZE AFTER THEY HAVE FINISHED AND BANKED. IF YOU DON'T, YOU WILL DELETE THEIR PRIZE! Make sure you let them bank AFTER double clicking the stone or it will delte that too. 

NOTES:

A) Keep in mind this is the first beta, so it will have bugs. Just report them to me and I can get them fixed

B) If you want me to make a script for you, just send me an email with the description of it and how it needs to work. There isn't any charge for it (like reporting one bug, or sending me a script). The only thing is I retain permission to use it.
