Ok, this script's easy to install
1.add the i_voodoo_book and the i_voodoo_harmer to sphereskills.scp or make
them available for players in some way.
2.Put the script in your scripts directory and resync.
3.That was easy, huh?

Comments and stupidities:
1.You might like to reduce the amount of damage dealt by this system
or reduce the possibilities to make the voodoo dolls.
2.Have fun and report the bugs with celerity.
