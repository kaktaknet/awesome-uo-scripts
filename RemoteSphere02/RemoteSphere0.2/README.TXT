Remote Sphere is a tool to easily connect with Sphere in telnet mode for remote administration.  It features a nice console which is a clone of the sphere console including the correct text colors, what isn't offered by a normal telnet program.  The FAQ contains all solutions you can try to solve any problems you may encounter.

Enjoy this program as much as you can and feel free to send comments at:  Dalzhim@videotron.ca or at Amlaruil@videotron.ca

2.1  What is Java?
____________________


Java is a very recent programming language designed to be totally portable, meaning this program (which is built in Java) should run on all platforms such as Windows, Linux and MacOS as long as the Java Runtime Environment is installed.  You can download the JRE at the following address:  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html

If you already have an older version of the JRE, it is strongly suggested that you uninstall it before installing version 1.4.1.

If you encounter any problems during the installation of Java, you can get help on these forums:

2.2  How to execute Remote Sphere?
____________________



If you have reached this step, it means you have Java's 1.4.1 version installed on your computer.  If you haven't done that yet, go back to step 2.1

Once that Java has been installed, you must make sure that all programs such as Winrar and Winace aren't associating Jar files.  If you double click on RemoteSphere.jar and it opens up in one of these programs, browse through the properties and uncheck the Jar extention association.  When there are no such programs associated with Jar files, you can double click RemoteSphere.jar and you should see the GUI of the program appearing on your screen.

2.5  Is there any tutorial to learn how to use Remote Sphere?
____________________



No, there is no tutorial on how to use Remote Sphere as I think it is a small and straightforward program.  If you can't understand how to use it, you can try asking for help in the Tool Help section of Script Sharing's forums ( http://scriptsharing.org/boards/viewforum.php?f=26 ).
